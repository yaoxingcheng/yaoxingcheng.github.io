I'm currently an undergraduate student at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University.

I know basic knowledge about deep machine learning, including:
  - commonly used neural network models, such as Transformer, LSTM, GNN and CNN
  - commonly used pipeline in NLP or CV.
  - some frameworks to train deep ML models such as [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
