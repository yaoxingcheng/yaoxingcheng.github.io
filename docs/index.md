My name is **Xingcheng Yao** (*姚星丞*)

I'm currently a researcher working at [Moonshot AI](https://www.moonshot.cn/), a startup AGI company. I graduated from [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (well known as ***Yao Class***), Tsinghua University. During my college year, I was once a research assistant at [Tsinghua KEG](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), a teaching assistant for [Data Structure](https://dsa.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~deng/ds/index.htm), and a visiting scholar at [Princeton NLP Group](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/).

### Projects

I'm quite proud of my final projects in several college courses:
- **[Cross Sentence Relation Extraction](https://yaoxingcheng.github.io/thesis/ai_final.pdf)** (*Artificial Intelligence*)
- **[Texi-Passenger Matching Process](https://yaoxingcheng.github.io/thesis/network_science.pdf)** (*Network Science*)
