My name is **Xingcheng Yao** (a.k.a *姚星丞*)

I'm currently a junior student at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (unofficially known as ***Yao Class***), Tsinghua University. During my college year, I was once a research assistant at [Tsinghua KEG](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), a teaching assistant for [Data Structure](https://dsa.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~deng/ds/index.htm), a research intern at [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home) and a visiting scholar at [Princeton NLP Group](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/).

### Research Interests

I have broad interests in machine learning (especially in the **application** of **deep learning**). Personally, I would prefer such research that is primarily driven by the following two goals:
- Developing **novel**, **effective** and **solid** methods that will significantly advance the performance of current deep learning algorithms on verticalized tasks.
- Improving the **efficiency** and **robustness** of the current SoTA deep learning techniques, so that they can be **scalable** and **generalizable** enough for real-world applications.

Here the first goal helps deep learning technologies thrive under academic contexts, while the second goal shift the evolution of deep learning from laboratory towards industry. I believe modern AI will gradually develop towards AGI when iterated in an interleaving manner with those two goals.

### Projects

I'm quite proud of my final projects in several courses:
- (*Artificial Intelligence*) Cross Sentence Relation Extraction \[[Thesis](https://yaoxingcheng.github.io/thesis/ai_final.pdf)\]
- (*Network Science*) Texi-Passenger Matching Process \[[Thesis](https://yaoxingcheng.github.io/thesis/network_science.pdf)\]
- (*Game Theory*) Strategy Transitivity in Zero-Sum Games \[[Thesis](https://yaoxingcheng.github.io/thesis/game_theory.pdf)\]

Apart from course projects, I also participated in several group projects:
- [COVID-Dashborad](https://covid-dashboard.aminer.cn): a visualization platform for pandemic data, winner of Tsinghua Chanllenge Cup, second prize
- [FatefulStars](https://github.com/yaoxingcheng/FatefulStars): a video game based on physical gravity, first place winner of [HackPKU 2021](https://www.hackpku.com/)
