My name is **Xingcheng Yao** (*姚星丞*). Welcome to my homepage!

I'm currently a researcher working at [Moonshot AI](https://www.moonshot.cn/), a startup AGI company. I received my Bachelor's degree from [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (well known as ***Yao Class***), Tsinghua University, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/) and Prof. [Zhilin Yang](https://kimiyoung.github.io/).
